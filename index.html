<h3><strong>4 April, 1856</strong></h3>
<p style="font-size:20px"> I am Nacny, I am married to the love of my life Willie. 
We were called to settle a town by the name of  Grafton. 
It is about 1 mile away from Virgin,Ut. We live in Virgin and were are waiting for the rest of the 
familes to get to Vrigin before we headout to Grafton.
Which will be by the end of the month. Willie as a 
print shop here in Vrigin and will come into Vrigin daily to work so he can still keep it open. 
We are <em>happy and exited</em> that 
Frank and Emma Platt are coming.Our children are really good friends with their grandchildren. 
Frank is a doctor and his office 
is in Vrigin by Willie's office. They decidce that they will go to Vrigin 
together so that they can leave a buggy with us in the case we need it. 
I want to write down as much as I can about our time in Grafton. Willie thinks that is a good idea for me 
to do that way when we are gone people will know about the frist familes in Grafton.
