    I am Nancy McFate. I am married to the most amazing man this side of the
    Mississippi William(Willie)Frederick McFate. Willie is a doctor and  
    I am a nures we meet in school. It is rear if women get to go to medical school.</p>
    
   <p>  We have three children on earth and two in haven, who
    we love dearly. Will and Fred are twins and are 6 years old. Then we have our
    sweet Evie.. We lost Sarah and Jane in
    Nauvoo when they contracted Malaria from mosquitoes. Many others also lost
    loved ones as well. We miss our sweet little girls. We left Nauvoo in with Brigam young in February of 1846. 
    After we got to Salt Lake we had our tiwn boys who we love. We even thought we could have children again. 
    Then we have Evie our sweet little girl who is about a 6 month old.

  We got a knock on our door late this eveing asking if we could meet with Brigam Yough our phophet after sunday meetings tomoorrw. 
  Brigham Yough as been send peopel all over Utah territory. I wounder were he would wants us to go. Willie and I deicde years ago that we will go 
  were ever we are ask to go. Willie hates to move because it means he will have to move his offcie again.

    What a Sunday it as been..... We had our meeting with Prestend Yough and we been ask to go down south to setttle a town he called Grafton. 
  He said that we will six months to get our things in order and everything we have here in the valley sold. Willie ask for a week  before we give him our answer.
  On the buggy ride home, I ask Willie what was his thoughts on moving again. He said he wants to make sure that is where we need to be. He wants to pray about it when me and fast about it before making a choice.
  </p>
<p> 
I know he is scared to move again. Soon after moving to Naoov after we jioed the chuch we all got sick with malaria. Sarah and Jane were the sicks and they passed away. Willie had a hard time with it. 
  There was nothing he could have done did. He did eveing he know as a docter to do. Then on the treak over to Salt Lake from Nauoo we lost many frireds along the way. 
  I am most lost my dear William Frederick. He got trap under a wagon when helpiing  push The Mcdonald's wagon out of the muck. Willie broke his arm and leg then he got supper ill with a fever and chills.
</p>
<p>I know he is not saying it ,but it is hard form him to move is docotrs office and he as a lot of peopel who look up to him for the health.  I also know that we will make the best chioce for us</p>

<p> After of parying, fasting, and talking about it we deicde that we need to go though with going were Yough as ask us to go. 
  We even talked about it with the boys becuse it means they would have to leave their school and friends. I was little scared to meet with BRigam, what if we were makeing the worrng choice. 
  I know that we did ,but I know that we are doing the right thing. 
</p>  
<p> 
In our meeting with Brigam he aswned all of the qustion will had. He told us that the Lord is knwign how hugde this scarfieee is for us. 
  He ask Willie if six months wil be enough time to get is office ready to move down.  Willie said that he could be ready to leave as soon as the end of the week if need. Brigam was so happy to hear that. I on the 
  other end was not. I think BEigam could tell I was neaves and said "Sister McFate, I told you six months at frist and I stand by my word".
