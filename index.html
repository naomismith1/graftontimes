   <p>  We have three children on earth and two in haven, who
    we love dearly. Will and Fred are twins and are 5 years old. Then we have our
    sweet Evie.. We lost Sarah and Jane in
    Nauvoo when they contracted Malaria from mosquitoes. Many others also lost
    loved ones as well. We miss our sweet little girls. We left Nauvoo in with Brigam young in February of 1846. 
    After we got to Salt Lake we had our tiwn boys who we love. We even thought we could have children again. 
    Then we have Evie our sweet little girl who is about a month old.</p>

    What a Sunday it as been..... We had our meeting with Prestend Yough and we been ask to go down south to setttle a town he called Grafton. 
  He said that we will six months to get our things in order and everything we have here in the valley sold. Willie ask for a week  before we give him our answer.
  On the buggy ride home, I ask Willie what was his thoughts on moving again. He said he wants to make sure that is where we need to be. He wants to pray about it when me and fast about it before making a choice.

I know he is scared to move again. Soon after moving to Naoov after we jioed the chuch we all got sick with malaria. Sarah and Jane were the sicks and they passed away. Willie had a hard time with it. 
  There was nothing he could have done did. He did eveing he know as a docter to do. Then on the treak over to Salt Lake from Nauoo we lost many frireds along the way. 
  I am most lost my dear William Frederick. He got trap under a wagon when helpiing  push The Mcdonald's wagon out of the muck. Willie broke his arm and leg then he got supper ill with a fever and chills.
