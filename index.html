Willie is a doctor and as an office in vigin which he will keep open and go there daily becuase most of his patients live in Vigin. He hopes our old horse can do all that work everyday. Jack Davies and Frank Platt have been called to be inchange of planting the cotton and wheat with the help of the other brothen.Right now Willie is the only one that as a day job that he can not leave.

We were told that the other famiiles will be here at the end of the month with Brother Tenney. The other familes are bring down te wheat and cotton form Salt Lake. which will gives us enough time to get all our homes and land sold. We do not what to leave Vigin. We have loved it there but we will still  see everyone we knew when we come to town to go to the store or church.
