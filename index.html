    I am Nancy McFate. I am married to the most amazing man this side of the
    Mississippi William(Willie)Frederick McFate. We have three children on earth and two in haven, who
    we love dearly. Will and Fred are twins and are 5 years old. Then we have our
    sweet Evie who is was just born a month ago. We lost Sarah and Jane in
    Nauvoo when they contracted Malaria from mosquitoes. Many others also lost
    loved ones as well. We miss our sweet little girls. We left Nauvoo in with Brigam young in February of 1846. 
  </p>
We have loved our time here in Virign
