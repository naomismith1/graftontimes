<p style="font-size:20px">
It as been a short three weeks as we said good by to the people that we love here in Virgin. 
We are exited to meet the rest of the familes that will be coming with us to Grafton. 
They all seem like nice familes, Annie Shrits looks good just for having a baby a month ago.
The Bareny's and Davies love all the children. The Barenys never had children and the Davies lost all of their children on the trek west.
We found out that Grafton will be growing cotton and wheat. Frank Platt  and Edward Shrits were ask to be in change of the planting and harvest.
Jack Davies was a teacher in Denmark and as been ask to teach the children. 
On April 30 we headed out to Grafton with  Brother Tenney he as been ask to take us to Grafton. 
He will also be helping planting the cotton trees and wheat.

<h3><strong>4 April 1856</strong></h3>
<p style="font-size:20px"> 
I am Nancy, I am married to the love of my life Willie. 
We were called to settle a town by the name of  Grafton. 
It is about 1 mile away from Virgin,Ut. We live in Virgin and were are waiting for the rest of the 
familes to get to Vrigin before we headout to Grafton.
Which will be by the end of the month. Willie as a 
print shop here in Vrigin and will come into Vrigin daily to work so he can still keep it open. 
We are <em>happy and exited</em> that 
Frank and Emma Platt are coming.Our children are really good friends with their grandchildren. 
Frank is a doctor and his office 
is in Vrigin by Willie's office. Willie and Frank  decidce that they will go to Vrigin 
together so that they can leave a buggy with us in the case we need it. 
I want to write down as much as I can about our time in Grafton. Willie thinks that is a good idea for me 
to do that way when we are gone people will know about the frist familes in Grafton.
