<h1>Grafton Times</h1>


<h3 style="text-align: left;"> 30 June 1859</h3>
The men got the ditch made so that when it rains the water won't go toward the homes and school. Willie as been doing his best to help when he can when he is not at his office. WHen Willie came home today he told us that scarlet fever was going a round and that we all need to stay in Grafton.

Today it rained and it rained hard. We are glad that we got the plants into the grown before it stated. It rained to the point that it flooded. We decide that we need a way for the water not get too close to our homes. tomorrow will be the first day Willie will not be home all day. He is going to his office twice a week so he is closer to his clients. We will miss him when he is gone all day. He made sure he helped as much as he can when he can.

  It as been a busy couple of days but all the homes and school house are done. We have been working on the wheat fields and marking where to put it. Jack Davies and Frank Platt decide that it may be too warm to plant the wheat now for it to be a good crop.  They did decide to plant the cotton trees and bushes.

  yesterday was a long day! We left later then we wanted to for Virgin and got to Grafton just before sunset. Today we got working on building our homes and get started on getting the fields ready to start planting. The men are hard at work when Willie had to run into Virgin because  Timothy Lee came and said that his daughter fall out of the loft and was in a lot of pain. Willie  hurry and got cleaned up and went to The Lee's home.  The other men decide to get our home done first and to add a sick house for Willie can bring people closer to him. Willie got home after dark and said that the Lee's daughter broke her arm and leg but should be fine. He was so surprise that our home was done and When he was told about the sick house he was grateful for it and said that he will use it. Our home is the only one that got done today and tomorrow the men will get working on the rest of the homes. Willie said that he wants the homes done before the sick house. Which all the men said that was a great idea as it soon will be the rainy season.

We were told that the other families will be here at the end of the month with Brother Tenney. The other families are bring down te wheat and cotton form Salt Lake. which will gives us enough time to get all our homes and land sold. We do not what to leave Virgin. We have loved it there but we will still  see everyone we knew when we come to town to go to the store or church.
